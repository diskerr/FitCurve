# FitCurve
Kotlin/Android port of Philip J. Schneider's "Algorithm for Automatically Fitting Digitized Curves" from the book "Graphics Gems"

This is a Kotlin/Android port of Philip J. Schneider's C code from https://github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems, a python implementation from https://github.com/volkerp/fitCurves, a JS implementation from https://github.com/soswow/fit-curve.

No additional dependency is required. Minumum SDK 21. Just open it with Android Studio and you can see a simple demo program that transforms a hand-drawing polyline to a fitted curve.
